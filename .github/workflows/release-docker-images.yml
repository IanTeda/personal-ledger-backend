# GitHub Actions Workflow: Build and Push Docker Images
#
# This workflow automates the CI/CD pipeline for building and publishing Docker images
# of the Personal Ledger Backend Rust application. It runs on GitHub's hosted runners
# and integrates with GitHub Container Registry (GHCR) for image storage.
#
# Workflow Overview:
# - Triggers: Runs when a GitHub release is published from the main branch
# - Jobs: Single job 'build-and-push' that handles checkout, setup, build, and push
# - Platforms: Builds multi-architecture images for Linux AMD64 and ARM64
# - Registry: Pushes to ghcr.io (GitHub Container Registry)
#
# GitHub Actions Used:
# - actions/checkout@v6: Checks out repository code with submodules
# - docker/setup-qemu-action@v3: Enables emulation for ARM64 builds on AMD64 runners
# - docker/setup-buildx-action@v3: Sets up Docker Buildx for advanced build features
# - docker/login-action@v3: Authenticates with GHCR using GITHUB_TOKEN
# - docker/metadata-action@v5: Generates tags and labels based on Git ref and semver
# - docker/build-push-action@v6: Builds and pushes multi-platform Docker images
#
# Environment: Runs on ubuntu-latest with necessary permissions for package writes.
