# GitHub Actions Workflow: Cargo Test Suite
#
# This workflow runs the complete test suite for the Personal Ledger Backend Rust application,
# including unit tests (in src/) and integration tests (in tests/). It ensures code quality
# and prevents regressions by running tests on every push to the main branch.
#
# Workflow Overview:
# - Triggers: Runs on pushes to the main branch
# - Jobs: Single job 'test' that runs on ubuntu-latest
# - Tests: Executes cargo test for both unit and integration tests
# - Caching: Uses Rust cache for faster builds
#
# GitHub Actions Used:
# - actions/checkout@v4: Checks out repository code with submodules
# - dtolnay/rust-toolchain@stable: Sets up stable Rust toolchain
# - Swatinem/rust-cache@v2: Caches Cargo dependencies for faster runs
# - Custom protoc installation: Installs Protocol Buffers compiler for builds
