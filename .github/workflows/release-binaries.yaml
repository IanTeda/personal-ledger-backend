# GitHub Actions Workflow: Build and Release Binaries
#
# This workflow automates the cross-platform compilation and distribution of binaries
# for the Personal Ledger Backend Rust application. It builds optimized release binaries
# for multiple architectures and operating systems, then packages and uploads them
# as release assets on GitHub.
#
# Workflow Overview:
# - Triggers: Runs when a GitHub release is published from the main branch
# - Jobs: Single matrix job 'build' that compiles for multiple platforms in parallel
# - Platforms: Linux (x86_64, ARM64), macOS (x86_64, ARM64), Windows (x86_64)
# - Outputs: Zipped/tarred binaries uploaded as GitHub release assets
#
# GitHub Actions Used:
# - actions/checkout@v4: Checks out repository code with recursive submodule pulling
# - Custom protoc installation: Installs Protocol Buffers compiler for gRPC builds
# - dtolnay/rust-toolchain@stable: Sets up Rust with target-specific cross-compilation
# - actions/upload-artifact@v4: Uploads build artifacts for inspection
# - softprops/action-gh-release@v1: Uploads binaries as release assets
#
# Cross-Compilation Details:
# - Uses Rust's built-in cross-compilation with custom linkers for ARM64
# - Archives binaries as .tar.gz (Unix) or .zip (Windows) with architecture names
# - Requires mutable releases enabled in repository settings for asset uploads
